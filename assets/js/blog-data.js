      <h2>MONTHLY UNIFYING SCENARIO</h2>
      
      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>Mr. Ade is a 52-year-old man who presents to a clinic with fatigue, swollen ankles, and reduced urine output. He has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and has not attended routine medical checkups for several years. His blood pressure on presentation is 168/102 mmHg. He admits that he frequently forgets to take his medications and lacks any structured health support.</p>
      <p>Based on his symptoms and history, early chronic kidney disease (CKD) is suspected.</p>

      <h3>HOW EACH ROLE IN THE HEALTH ECOSYSTEM RESPONDS</h3>

      <h4>1. Clinician / Doctor</h4>
      <p>The doctor orders kidney function tests, including creatinine, eGFR, and urinalysis, assesses for complications, adjusts his antihypertensive medications, and explains the seriousness of early CKD. A management plan is developed, and follow-up visits are scheduled.</p>

      <h4>2. Nurse</h4>
      <p>The nurse records vital signs, reviews medication adherence, teaches Mr. Ade how to monitor his blood pressure at home, provides education on low-salt diets, and ensures he understands his treatment plan.</p>

      <h4>3. Medical Student</h4>
      <p>Under supervision, the medical student takes a detailed history, performs a physical examination, reviews basic laboratory findings, and presents the case to the doctor while learning about CKD and effective patient communication.</p>

      <h4>4. Medical Laboratory Scientist</h4>
      <p>The laboratory scientist conducts tests including creatinine, urea, electrolytes, and urinalysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability of results. Abnormal kidney markers are promptly reported to support clinical decision-making.</p>

      <h4>5. Allied Health Professionals</h4>
      <p><strong>Dietitian:</strong> Develops a kidney-friendly, low-sodium diet and counsels the patient on lifestyle changes.</p>
      <p><strong>Pharmacist:</strong> Reviews and adjusts medications according to kidney function and helps prevent drug-related complications.</p>
      <p><strong>Physiotherapist:</strong> Designs a safe exercise plan to support blood pressure control and overall health.</p>

      <h4>6. Public Health Professional</h4>
      <p>The public health professional recognizes Mr. Ade as part of a high-risk population and links his case to broader issues such as poor hypertension control. Community education, screening programs, and early CKD detection initiatives are planned.</p>

      <h4>7. Health Manager / Administrator</h4>
      <p>The administrator ensures the clinic is equipped with blood pressure monitors, laboratory resources, trained staff, and proper record systems. Referral pathways, follow-up systems, and quality improvement processes are coordinated.</p>

      <h4>8. Caregiver</h4>
      <p>The caregiver supports Mr. Ade by helping him remember medications, monitoring daily blood pressure, encouraging dietary changes, providing emotional support, and ensuring he attends follow-up appointments.</p>

      <h4>9. Health Software Developer</h4>
      <p>The developer maintains digital systems that flag declining kidney function, send medication reminders, track blood pressure readings, alert clinicians to worsening results, and provide educational resources for patients and caregivers.</p>

      <h3>Unified Message</h3>
      <p><strong>Every role matters. Every action counts.</strong><br>
      A strong health ecosystem protects lives—just as Helpers Dynasty does.</p>
