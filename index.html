<h2>Bi‑Monthly Unifying Scenario</h2>
<article>
<h3>Early CKD — A Shared Healthcare Response</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Mr. Ade, 52, presents with fatigue, swollen ankles, low urine output, and uncontrolled hypertension. His BP is 168/102 mmHg, and he has poor medication adherence. Early Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is suspected.</p>


<h4>How Each Member of the Health Ecosystem Responds</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinician:</strong> Orders kidney tests, adjusts medication, and creates a plan.</li>
<li><strong>Nurse:</strong> Reinforces adherence, monitors vitals, and educates on diet.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Student:</strong> Takes history, performs exam, interprets basic labs.</li>
<li><strong>Lab Scientist:</strong> Runs kidney markers accurately and flags abnormalities.</li>
<li><strong>Allied Health:</strong> (Dietitian, Pharmacist, Physiotherapist) — diet, meds, exercise guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Public Health Officer:</strong> Identifies population risk + community strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Health Manager:</strong> Ensures supplies, systems, referrals, and quality control.</li>
<li><strong>Caregiver:</strong> Supports adherence, BP checks, diet, and follow‑ups.</li>
<li><strong>Health Software Developer:</strong> Builds apps for reminders, alerts, BP tracking, education.</li>
</ul>
